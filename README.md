## The Dawgs Behind the Design

MC BLOCKA refers to its users as “dawgs”—a nod to hip-hop culture’s language of respect and solidarity. The bulldog avatars throughout the extension represent that community spirit. They're not just mascots; they're digital stand-ins for loyalty, focus, and presence in the online space.
